# Background and Overview

## Project Context

This project examines the real estate market in Connecticut, focusing on single-family home sales between 2001 and 2021. The data, sourced from the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management (OPM), provides insights into property transactions exceeding $2,000. The primary aim of this analysis is to explore trends in home sales, understand key factors influencing property values, and build a predictive model to estimate future sale prices.

## Main Goal

To develop a data-driven approach for forecasting single-family home prices in Connecticut, utilizing historical sales data to identify patterns and drivers of property valuation. This model serves as a tool for real estate professionals, investors, and policymakers to make informed decisions based on market dynamics.

## Key Metrics

- Year-over-year changes in sale prices and assessed values.
- Sales ratio trends, representing the relationship between assessed value and sale price.
- Key drivers influencing sale prices.

Key fields include town, property address, sales price, property assessment value, and sales ratio. The dataset covers sales reported between October 1 and September 30 each year, as required by Connecticut General Statutes.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- Random Forest Regressor for predictive modeling of sale prices.
